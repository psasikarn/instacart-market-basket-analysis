# instacart-market-basket-analysis
This project used the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis/overview.
I worked on this for a 48-hour take home test for Data Science Intern position, so the dataset is sampled.

The order of the work are: 
1) Explore
2) Aggregate_data 
3) Combine_features 
4) Create_training_set
5) Train
6) Create_test_set_and_predict
